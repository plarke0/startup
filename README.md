[My Notes](notes.md)

A website to help you keep track of your money. By creating budget categories, you can more easily build your savings, set aside your tithing, and stick with your budgeting plans. It allows you to deposit money between these budget categories according to customizable ratios. Every action is logged, giving you an in depth history of what you have done with your money.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses the correct HTML structure. There will be three HTML pages. One for signing up, one for logging in, and one for the budget application.
- **CSS** - CSS that allows for adjustable screen sizes, makes good use of space, and makes good use of color, leading to an aesthetically pleasing experience.
- **React** - Makes up the login/signup, updates totals/logs after useer input, and allows for the user to switch between interfaces in the budget page.
- **Service** - Backend server functionality for the following:
  - Saving and retrieving user budget data
  - Sign up, login, and log out for each user
  - Calculation of values for deposits, withdrawls, and log modifications
  - Calls to https://www.purgomalum.com to check for inappropriate usernames/category names
- **DB/Login** - Store users, total values, saved ratio profiles, and logs. Register and log in users, securely storing user credentials. Unable to access budget page without account.
- **WebSocket** - Display number of total and concurrent users that have accounts.
