### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses the correct HTML structure. There will be three HTML pages. One for signing up, one for logging in, and one for the budget application.
- **CSS** - CSS that allows for adjustable screen sizes, makes good use of space, and makes good use of color, leading to an aesthetically pleasing experience.
- **React** - Makes up the login/signup, updates totals/logs after useer input, and allows for the user to switch between interfaces in the budget page.
- **Service** - Backend server functionality for the following:
  - Saving and retrieving user budget data
  - Sign up, login, and log out for each user
  - Calculation of values for deposits, withdrawls, and log modifications
  - Calls to https://www.purgomalum.com to check for inappropriate usernames/category names
- **DB/Login** - Store users, total values, saved ratio profiles, and logs. Register and log in users, securely storing user credentials. Unable to access budget page without account.
- **WebSocket** - Display number of total and concurrent users that have accounts.
